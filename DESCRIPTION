Description: In "Risk Prediction with imperfect survival outcome information from electronic health records", authors Jue Hou, Stephanie F. Chan, Xuan Wang, and Tianxi Cai describe a method for conducting risk prediction on survival outcome date when we only have gold standard data for a small subset of observations. This package builds on the authors' original implementation by making several important computational improvements, cutting down overall computation time by at least a factor of four.
